### Results and Explanation

**ECB Mode**:

- If a bit is corrupted, only that block is affected.

**CBC Mode**:

- If a bit is corrupted, both the current block and the next block are affected.

**CFB & OFB Modes**:

- If a bit is corrupted, only one byte is affected.

**Implications of these differences**:
Different encryption modes have varying levels of impact when a bit error occurs. This helps us understand the security and data integrity when using different encryption modes.

### Exercise 4.2: Encryption Mode – ECB vs. CBC

1. **Separate header and body**:
    
    ```bash
    dd if=origin.bmp of=header.bin bs=1 count=54
    dd if=origin.bmp of=body.bin bs=1 skip=54
    
    ```

## 4. Results and Explanation

### a) : How much information can you recover by decrypting the corrupted file, if the encryption mode is ECB, CBC, CFB, or OFB, respectively?

**Answer**:

- **ECB (Electronic Codebook Mode)**: In ECB mode, each block is encrypted independently. If a bit in a block is corrupted, only that block will be affected when decrypted. Therefore, the information recovered will be almost complete, with only the corrupted block being unreadable.
- **CBC (Cipher Block Chaining Mode)**: In CBC mode, each block of plaintext is XORed with the previous ciphertext block before being encrypted. If a bit in a block is corrupted, the corrupted block and the next block will be affected when decrypted. Thus, you will lose the information in the corrupted block and the next block.
- **CFB (Cipher Feedback Mode)**: CFB mode turns a block cipher into a stream cipher. A corrupted bit in the ciphertext affects the corresponding bit in the plaintext and also affects the subsequent blocks. The corrupted bit will affect only one byte in the plaintext, but the error will propagate.
- **OFB (Output Feedback Mode)**: OFB mode also turns a block cipher into a stream cipher, similar to CFB. A corrupted bit in the ciphertext will affect the corresponding bit in the plaintext only, and it won't propagate to subsequent blocks. Therefore, only the corrupted byte will be unreadable, and the rest of the plaintext can be recovered.

### b) Explain.

**Answer**:

- **ECB**: Since ECB encrypts each block independently, a single bit corruption only affects the corresponding block, making it possible to recover the rest of the plaintext without issue.
- **CBC**: CBC mode propagates the error to the next block because each block is dependent on the previous one. A corrupted bit in one block will corrupt that block and the next block upon decryption.
- **CFB**: In CFB mode, a corrupted bit affects only one byte of the plaintext, but the error will propagate to the subsequent blocks. This happens because each bit of the plaintext depends on the previous bits of the ciphertext.
- **OFB**: In OFB mode, a corrupted bit only affects the corresponding bit in the plaintext and does not propagate further. This is because OFB mode generates keystream blocks independently of the ciphertext, and thus, errors do not propagate.

### c)  What is the implication of these differences?

**Answer**:

- **ECB**: The independent encryption of blocks in ECB makes it less resilient to corruption but easier to isolate and recover unaffected blocks. However, it also makes it less secure for practical encryption since patterns in the plaintext can be visible in the ciphertext.
- **CBC**: The error propagation in CBC mode means that it is more sensitive to corruption. This makes it less robust in scenarios where data integrity cannot be guaranteed, but it offers better security for practical encryption.
- **CFB**: The error propagation in CFB mode is limited to one byte in the plaintext and subsequent blocks. This makes it more robust against bit corruption compared to CBC, but still more vulnerable than OFB.
- **OFB**: OFB mode is the most resilient to bit corruption among the mentioned modes because it only affects the corresponding bit in the plaintext without propagating further. This makes it suitable for applications where data integrity is crucial, although it may be less secure than CBC due to its stream cipher nature.

These differences highlight the trade-offs between error resilience and security in different encryption modes, which is crucial for choosing the appropriate encryption method based on the application's requirements.
